## API Credentials Protection

API credentials provide direct access to your brokerage account and must be protected with the highest level of security.

### Storing API Keys

- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables rather than in code or configuration files.
  ```bash
  export SCHWAB_API_KEY="your_api_key"
  export SCHWAB_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
  ```

- **Secret Management Services**: For production deployments, use a secret management service:
  - AWS Secrets Manager
  - HashiCorp Vault
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Google Secret Manager

- **Encryption**: Encrypt API credentials at rest using strong encryption (AES-256 or better).

- **Access Control**: Restrict access to API credentials to only those who absolutely need it.

### Credential Rotation

- Rotate API credentials regularly (at least every 90 days).
- Immediately rotate credentials if a team member with access leaves or if a breach is suspected.
- Implement a secure process for credential rotation that minimizes downtime.

### Environment-Specific Credentials

- Use different API credentials for development, testing, and production environments.
- Limit permissions for development and testing credentials to reduce risk.

## Secure Deployment

### Server Security

- Use a dedicated server or virtual machine for production deployments.
- Keep the operating system and all software up to date.
- Implement a firewall to restrict inbound and outbound connections.
- Disable unnecessary services and ports.
- Use SSH key-based authentication for server access.
- Disable root login and use sudo for administrative tasks.

### Container Security

If deploying with Docker or other containers:

- Use official base images from trusted sources.
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Run containers with minimal privileges.
- Never store secrets in Docker images or Dockerfiles.
- Implement proper isolation between containers.

Example Docker security configuration:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml with security configurations
version: '3.8'
services:
  trading-app:
    image: voicetradewithschwab:latest
    user: nonroot  # Run as non-root user
    read_only: true  # Read-only filesystem
    tmpfs:  # Writable temporary storage
      - /tmp
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true  # Prevent privilege escalation
    environment:
      - SCHWAB_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/schwab_api_key
      - SCHWAB_API_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/schwab_api_secret
    secrets:
      - schwab_api_key
      - schwab_api_secret

secrets:
  schwab_api_key:
    external: true
  schwab_api_secret:
    external: true
```

### Cloud Deployment

For cloud deployments:

- Use private subnets for resources that don't need direct internet access.
- Implement a WAF (Web Application Firewall) for public-facing components.
- Use IAM roles with the principle of least privilege.
- Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Regularly audit cloud resources and permissions.

## Network Security

### TLS Configuration

- Require TLS 1.2 or higher for all connections.
- Use strong cipher suites and disable weak protocols.
- Implement certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Configure proper certificate management and automated renewal.

Example Nginx configuration for secure TLS:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name trading.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256';
    
    ssl_session_timeout 1d;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:50m;
    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;
    
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;
}
```

### IP Restrictions

- Limit API access to specific IP addresses when possible.
- Use VPN for remote access to administration interfaces.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

### API Security

- Implement request signing for API requests.
- Use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens.
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs.
- Set reasonable rate limits on API endpoints.

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts.
- Enforce strong password policies:
  - Minimum length of 12 characters
  - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Regular password rotation (every 90 days)
  - Password history to prevent reuse

- Use secure session management:
  - Set secure and HttpOnly flags on cookies
  - Implement proper session timeouts
  - Regenerate session IDs after authentication

### Authorization

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
- Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Regularly audit user permissions.
- Implement proper authorization checks at all levels (UI, API, service).

Example RBAC roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Viewer | Can view account information and market data |
| Trader | Viewer + can execute trades |
| Admin | Trader + can manage users and system settings |
| Super Admin | All permissions + credential management |

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

Classify data according to sensitivity:

1. **Public**: Information that can be freely disclosed
2. **Internal**: Information for internal use only
3. **Confidential**: Sensitive information requiring protection
4. **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

### Data Encryption

- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
- Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048 or better).
- Implement proper key management.
- Encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.2+.

### Data Minimization

- Collect and store only necessary data.
- Implement data retention policies.
- Securely delete data when no longer needed.

### Backup and Recovery

- Regularly back up all critical data.
- Encrypt backups and store them securely.
- Test restoration procedures regularly.
- Implement a disaster recovery plan.

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Security Monitoring

- Implement comprehensive logging for all security-relevant events.
